# Discord-Bot
This repository contains the code for a Discord Bot that reads negative words in a message and responds with encouraging replies. It can be also prompted to return inspirational quotes.
<br>
<br>
The script is written in python. Online IDE replit was used as it makes it easier to have the bot online (hosting it locally would prevent it from being online 24/7). The bot was hosted via UptimeRobot (which is free of cost, btw). The script for it is present in the file "keep_alive"

<br>
Visit Discord's Developer Portal in order to create a bot user and give it bot permissions.

Replit's new update has a different segment for secret environment files (instead of .env ones) Calling of that file is also different now. Refer to the last line of the script to know the syntax. Make sure to NOT SHARE the TOKEN. People can manipulate your bot and things can get frisky :')

p.s.: feel free to fork the repo and create your own versions. I'd rather prefer a bot spitting jokes than making me diabetic with positive affirmations.
